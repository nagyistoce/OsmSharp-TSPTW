# OsmSharp.TSPTW

A small library for reading and writing Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) with Time Window instances and testing performance of OsmSharp in solving these problems.

The format used is the same as use by Manuel López-Ibáñez and Christian Blum and all instance can be download from their website. A huge thanks to them for so publicly and openly publishing their data!
