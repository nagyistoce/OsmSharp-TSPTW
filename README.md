A small library for reading and writing Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) with Time Window instances and testing performance of OsmSharp in solving these problems.

The format used is the same as used by Manuel López-Ibáñez and Christian Blum and all instance can also be downloaded from their website. A huge thanks to them for publishing their data!
